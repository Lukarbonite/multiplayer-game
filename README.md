# üéÆ Multiplayer Cell Eater Game

A real-time multiplayer game inspired by Agar.io, built with Node.js, Socket.IO, and HTML5 Canvas. Features advanced cell mechanics, a highly configurable client, cross-platform controls, and full Xbox controller support.

## üöÄ Features

### üéØ Core Gameplay
- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play with others in a persistent world.
- **Cell Mechanics**: Grow by eating pellets, split your cells to attack or flee, and merge back together after a cooldown.
- **Virus System**: Spiky green cells that split larger players on consumption. Can be "fed" with ejected mass, causing them to duplicate in the direction of the mass.
- **Mass Ejection**: Strategically eject mass to feed other players, bait enemies, or feed viruses.
- **Live Leaderboard**: See the top players and your real-time ranking.
- **Minimap & Coordinates**: Navigate the world with a real-time minimap and on-screen coordinates.

### ‚ö° Performance & Optimization
- **Spatial Hashing**: Efficient server-side collision detection for high player counts.
- **Interest-Based Updates**: The server only sends data for objects within a player's "interest radius," dramatically reducing bandwidth.
- **Configurable Update Rates**: Separate server-side physics (60Hz) and network (30Hz) loops for smooth gameplay and efficient networking.
- **Client-Side Prediction & Interpolation**: Ensures smooth player movement, even with network latency.
- **Render Caching**: The leaderboard is cached and only re-rendered periodically to save client resources.

### üé® Customization & UI
- **Custom Appearance**: Choose your cell color or upload a custom image (with automatic server-side resizing).
- **In-Depth Settings Panel**: Fine-tune your experience with a wide range of performance and visual settings.
- **Persistent Score**: An option to save your score upon disconnecting and resume with it in your next session.
- **Collapsible Chat**: In-game chat that can be minimized to reduce screen clutter.
- **Detailed Debug Mode**: An overlay showing cell merge cooldowns, client-server sync distance, zoom levels, and controller status.

### üéÆ Multi-Platform Controls
- **Desktop**: Classic and responsive mouse and keyboard controls.
- **Mobile**: Intuitive touch controls with a virtual joystick and dedicated action buttons.
- **Xbox Controller**: Full plug-and-play support for Xbox 360/One controllers with aiming, haptic feedback, and configurable sensitivity.
- **Custom Mobile Keyboard**: An on-screen keyboard for chatting on mobile devices without relying on the native OS keyboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd multiplayer-game
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
4.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "express": "^4.x.x",
  "socket.io": "^4.x.x"
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```
multiplayer-game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js              # Main server file (Node.js, Express, Socket.IO)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Game client HTML structure
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.js            # Client-side game logic and rendering
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css          # Styling, responsive design, and UI
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json           # Project dependencies

## üåê Network & Performance

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Server Simulation**: Physics runs at a fixed **60Hz** for consistency.
- **Network Updates**: Game state is broadcast at **30Hz** to balance performance and real-time feel.
- **Client-Side Prediction**: Player movement feels instantaneous by predicting actions locally.
- **Position Interpolation**: Smooths out other players' movements to compensate for network jitter and lag.

### Optimized Performance
- **Spatial Hashing**: Server uses a spatial hash grid to perform collision and consumption checks, avoiding O(n¬≤) complexity.
- **Interest Management**: The server only sends updates for entities within a player's field of view, significantly reducing network traffic.
- **Delta Updates**: Only changed, new, or removed cells are sent to clients, not the entire game state on every tick.
- **Image Compression**: User-uploaded images are automatically resized and compressed on the client before being sent to the server.

## üîß Configuration

Key server settings can be adjusted in `server.js`:

### World & Gameplay
```javascript
const WORLD_WIDTH = 4000;
const WORLD_HEIGHT = 4000;
const PELLET_COUNT = 1000;
const VIRUS_COUNT = 50;
const PLAYER_MERGE_TIME = 15000; // ms
const VIRUS_EJECTIONS_TO_SPLIT = 7; // Feeds to split a virus
```

### Performance Tuning
```javascript
const PHYSICS_UPDATE_RATE = 60; // Hz
const NETWORK_UPDATE_RATE = 30; // Hz
const INTEREST_RADIUS = 1500;   // Player's view distance for updates
const SPATIAL_HASH_CELL_SIZE = 200;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

-   **Controller not detected?**
    -   Ensure your browser supports the Gamepad API (most modern browsers do).
    -   Connect the controller *before* starting the game or refresh the page after connecting.
-   **High latency/lag?**
    -   Check your internet connection.
    -   On the client, try lowering the **Render Distance** and **Frame Rate Limit** in the settings panel.
-   **Can't connect to the server?**
    -   Verify the server is running with `node server.js`.
    -   Check for firewall or antivirus software that might be blocking the connection on the specified port.
-   **"Remember My Score" not working?**
    -   This feature requires your browser to allow `localStorage`. It may not work in private/incognito mode or if cookies/site data are blocked.
